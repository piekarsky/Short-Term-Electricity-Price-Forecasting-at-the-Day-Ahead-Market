# Short-Term-Electricity-Price-Forecasting-at-the-Polish-Power-Exchange-Day-Ahead-Market


### 1. Overview
This repository contains the experimental source code for short term electricity price forecasting at the Polish Power Exchange Day Ahead Market  including RNN, LSTM, GRU, MLP and Prophet models.

According to the table below, **RNN** outperformed the other models

| Model | MAE↓ | RMSE↓ | MAPE↓ | R Squared↑ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Prophet | 16.9 | 21.8 | 7.54 | 0.86 |
| MLP | 16.61 | 21.23 | 7.32 | 0.87 |
| RNN (Vanilla) | 16.15 | 21.33 | 6.94 | 0.86 |
| LSTM | 17.15 | 22.5 | 7.26 | 0.85 | 
| GRU | 17 | 22.12 | 7.32 | 0.86 |


In the picture below shows the actual and forecast electricity price at the Polish Power Exchange Day Ahead Market in the sample period. Forecasts have been generated by the model based on the Vanilla RNN, which was characterized by
the highest accuracy of electricity price predictions in the test period.
